TODO:
    - To solve the problem where you have multiple references to the same object in the graph
        just put ids and determine the truth of these objects in the graph
        put a getter and setter on the objects with id references which will fetch the objects based on id
        (this may require back references in the object graph)
    - broadcast web socket disconnect and reconnect. panels need to call get_x again to re-sync with data
    - add paging to get_bookings(from=3434324, to=34343245).
        Otherwise users will need to pull down all the bookings ever when they only need to see bookings that will
        show on the calendar current calendar view
    - Keep surrogates in sync. e.g. when getting booking.resource try: store.user.cal.resources.find(id==id) else return surrogate
        if resource is deleted from all resources the server should emit update_booking to keep any bookings with references to that resource in sync
